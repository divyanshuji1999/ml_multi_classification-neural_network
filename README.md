# RECOGNIZING HANDWRITTEN DIGITS

#Multi-class Classiﬁcation

In this, i have implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
For this, i have use logistic regression and neural networks to RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS (FROM 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. This exercise will show you how the methods you’ve learned can be used for this classiﬁcation task. In the ﬁrst part of the exercise, you will extend your previous implemention of logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classiﬁcation.

#Nueral networks
In the previous, i have implemented multi-class logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits. However, logistic regression cannot form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classiﬁer.
In this part, i have implemented a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. For this week, you will be using parameters from a neural network that we have already trained. My goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction. The provided script, ex3 nn.m, will help you step through this.
